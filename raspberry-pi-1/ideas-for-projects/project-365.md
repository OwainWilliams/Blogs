# Project 365

Setup a Raspberry Pi zero with camera and leave it in situ for 365 days. 

Each photo will be saved to the cloud as a backup.

Issues: 

* If I move house within the next year, the project will need to restart ðŸ¤£
* If power is lost but can't do anythign about that. 
* If upload fails 
  * Maybe do batch uploads and once upload is successful, delete batch - need to think about that one.
