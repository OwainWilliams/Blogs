* Make sure Visual Studio has Node.js projects installed as a project type
* Create new project and click on `Install more tools and features` and then add Node project.
* I added a seperate project to my solution, this was a node project. 
  * This was to keep my frontend framework away from Umbraco and away from my backend controllers etc.
* I installed NPM task runner via the Extension tool in VS.
* Then ran the following commands in a command prompt outwith Visual Studio in the project folder.
  * npm init - setup the npm package
  * npm install jquery
  * npm install what-input
  * npm install foundation-sites
