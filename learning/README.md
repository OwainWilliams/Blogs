# Learning

So I am rubbish at remembering stuff when it comes to life in general and coding is no different. 

I've decided to try and make this a scrap book of code snippets, things that I have found really interesting or useful.   
I will also look to put more detail in to code snippets that I maybe don't fully understand.
