# Blogs

## Can I become who I want to be?

That's a tough question but thankfully, our team is on it. Please bear with us while we're investigating.

## Have you had a chance to answer the previous question?

Yes, after a few months we finally found the answer. Sadly, Mike is on vacations right now so I'm afraid we are not able to provide the answer at this point.

This will be a public repo of blog ideas, partly started blogs and other things that I do plan to publish on owain.code. I guess this is the beta release of any final blogs.

I'll cover things I have built, learnt and general experimenting with coding. Maybe some Raspberry Pi, some Umbraco, some C\#, some general ramblings.
